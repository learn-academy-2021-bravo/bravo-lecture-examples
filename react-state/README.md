# React State

### App Setup
- $ yarn create react-app react-state
- $ cd react-state
- $ yarn start


### Creating a Class Component
- import
- define the class and extend Component
- render method
- return (one thing)
- export


### Vocab
- Hard coding - opposite of dynamic coding
- onClick - attribute of a JSX tags that calls a method
- this.setState - built in method for React, its job is interacting with the state object, output React methods, return in JavaScript function, there should only be one setState per method, and when the setState executes the method is done


### Additional Components
- Put all your additional files in a folder called `components` inside the src folder
- File path: `react-state/src/components/MonthlyRunning.js`


### Useful Error Message
- 'ComponentName' is not defined - means you need to import the component
- `import MonthlyRunning from './components/MonthlyRunning'`
